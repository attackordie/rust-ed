Thanks to contributors of rust-ed
==================================

rust-ed has been made possible by the work of many individuals and projects.


Direct Contributors:
--------------------

(This section will be updated as contributions are received)

We welcome contributions! See AUTHORS for how to contribute.


Inspiration and Foundations:
-----------------------------

Ken Thompson
  For creating the original Unix ed editor in 1969, establishing the
  foundation of line-oriented text editing and developing regular
  expression support for text manipulation.

Dennis Ritchie
  For co-creating Unix with Ken Thompson, providing the operating system
  environment that made ed the standard text editor.

Andrew L. Moore
  For creating GNU ed and bringing ed into the free software world.

François Pinard
  For contributions to GNU ed development.

Antonio Diaz Diaz
  For maintaining GNU ed and releasing version 1.22.2, which rust-ed
  targets for complete compatibility.


Tools and Technologies:
-----------------------

The Rust Programming Language Team
  For creating Rust and its safety-first approach to systems programming,
  making memory-safe ed possible.

The Rust Community
  For excellent crates that rust-ed depends on:
  - clap: Command-line argument parsing
  - regex: POSIX-compatible regular expressions
  - thiserror: Error handling
  - nix: POSIX signal handling

The Free Software Foundation
  For the GNU Project, GNU coding standards, and the GPL license that
  ensures software freedom.

Docker
  For containerization technology that enables reliable differential testing.


Bug Reports and Testing:
-------------------------

(This section will be updated as bug reports are received)

We appreciate all bug reports and testing feedback!
Report bugs at: https://github.com/attackordie/rust-ed/issues


Documentation and Standards:
-----------------------------

GNU Coding Standards
  For providing clear guidelines on creating GNU-compatible software.

The GNU ed Manual Authors
  For comprehensive documentation that aided in understanding ed's behavior.


Special Thanks:
---------------

The Boynton Family
  For their unwavering support and patience during the development of
  rust-ed. Your encouragement made this project possible.

Darrin Taylor
  For insisting that the Rust version be reviewable side-by-side with the
  GNU C version. This design principle led to the immutable reference
  structure and systematic C-to-Rust translation methodology that ensures
  100% compatibility.

Cameron Míċeál Tyre
  For tireless efforts in reporting and solving installation issues on
  macOS, including diagnosing persistent Cargo cache issues that affected
  the build process. His detailed bug reports and testing on multiple
  platforms (MacBook and Android/Pixel) helped improve the build reliability
  and cross-platform compatibility of rust-ed.

The Linux and BSD Communities
  For maintaining ed in various distributions and keeping the tradition
  of standard Unix tools alive.


Educational Resources:
----------------------

Brian W. Kernighan and P. J. Plauger
  "Software Tools in Pascal" (Addison-Wesley, 1981)
  The algorithm upon which both GNU ed and rust-ed are based.

The Unix Programming Environment
  For documenting the Unix philosophy and ed usage patterns.
