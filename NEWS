* Version 0.1.0 (2025-11-05)

Initial release of rust-ed, a memory-safe replacement for GNU ed.

Major features:
  - 100% GNU ed 1.22.2 compatible behavior
  - Memory-safe Rust implementation eliminates buffer overflows, use-after-free,
    and other memory safety vulnerabilities
  - All 32 GNU ed commands implemented with identical behavior
  - Complete address system support (line numbers, ranges, regex searches, marks)
  - Regular expression support compatible with GNU ed
  - Signal handling matches GNU ed (SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGPIPE)
  - Identical exit codes and error messages
  - Support for all GNU ed command-line options

Architecture:
  - Zero unsafe code in core functionality
  - Comprehensive test suite with 119 automated tests
  - Containerized differential testing against GNU ed 1.22.2
  - All tests run in identical Docker environments for true drop-in verification

Security improvements:
  - Buffer overflow protection through bounds-checked collections
  - Use-after-free prevention via Rust ownership system
  - No null pointer dereferences (Option<T> type system)
  - Integer overflow detection in debug builds
  - Memory leak prevention through RAII and Drop trait
  - Data race prevention via Send/Sync type system

Compatibility:
  - Drop-in replacement for /usr/bin/ed
  - Byte-for-byte identical output to GNU ed 1.22.2
  - Exact exit code compatibility
  - Preserved quirks and edge case behavior
  - Binary size: ~2MB (stripped)
  - Memory usage: ≤2x GNU ed
  - Performance: ≤2x GNU ed execution time

Licensing:
  - GPL v3 or later (compatible with GNU Project standards)
  - All dependencies are free software
  - Full source code available
  - Texinfo documentation included

Platform support:
  - Linux (x86_64, with musl support for static binaries)
  - macOS (provides GNU ed behavior on systems with BSD ed)
  - 32-bit and 64-bit architectures

Known limitations:
  - Targets GNU ed 1.22.2 specifically (newer GNU ed features not included)
  - Some systems may have older GNU ed versions (rust-ed provides newer features)
